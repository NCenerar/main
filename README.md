#Delete Duplicate Files
If you are like me, you have a lot of duplicate files on your hard drive.
I'm doing so many backup that in the end, I get a lot of duplicates.
But the time has come to organize my music library and I cannot let duplicates mess up my library.
I want to tag and organize my music so that I can build a clean library.
That's why I developed this plugin.
After adding my files into MusicBrainz Picard, I have a context menu action that find and delete duplicate files.
