Hello, I am Nicolas Cenerario and this is my main public repository.
It will contain all my little projects and notes.

#Fake Picard
This little project is just an fake Picard implementation
so that I can develop my plugin with Picard API without having to build Picard.
It only gives a view of Picard API and should integrate what is available but stay a small as possible.
