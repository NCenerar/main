Hello, I am Nicolas Cenerario and this is my main public repository.
It will contain all my little projects and notes.

#Fake Picard
This little project is just an fake Picard implementation
so that I can develop my plugin with Picard API without having to build Picard.
It only gives a view of Picard API and should integrate what is available but stay a small as possible.

#Really Clear Metadata
If you enable the "clear existing tags" option, it might happen that in some particular circumstances,
MusicBrainz Picard will not be able to clear all metadata properly from certain files.
This plugin provide a context menu action that allow to clear all metadata from a file or a group of file.
